# SnakeHealthMod

## Thanks
Huge thanks to ClockworkVulpine on discord for the Artwork! <3

## What does it do?

This mod adds a single card to the game that has the "SnakeMinigameIcon" special ability.

The ability will activate when drawn, and will start a game of snake. The score you get in snake is equal to the buff to the cards health.


## Installation -
### Automatic
Now usable with Thunderstore mod manager!

### Manual
Simply add the dll to your BepInEx/Plugins folder
